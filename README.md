# JavaFX_Template


When creating an application we typically want


* A toolbar, a menubar and a status bar.
* Some way to store local state
* A 'View' area, with a way to switch between views
* A nice gradle configuration for creating shadowjars


This was created as a IntelliJ project template to get nice defaults for when creating new applications. It has some settings to allow interop with clojure from gradle settings. This template also has some H2 database settings for creating local state using a keyvalue store, bag store, or graph-like storage.
